# Camera
For this project, I wanted to recreate a still camera in CSS. First of all you have to click on the "Prendre une photo" button

Then the camera appears if we're flying over the "take a picture" button it goes down a little and if we click it takes the picture

The red button will blink, a flash will appear and then the camera lens will close.

Then finally the picture appears: if we're flying over the heart it begins to turn and if we click upon it, it brings us back toward the still camera to take a picture back again.
